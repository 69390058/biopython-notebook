biopython-notebook
==================

Notebooks to introduce biopython. The vast majority of the content is
scooped from somewhere else. We am just responsible for making a Jupyter version
of otherwise existing content.

Most content here is based on the [Biopython tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).


Docker instructions
-------------------
Pre built docker image with these notebooks is avalible [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/biopython/biopython-tutorial/)
For docker we need to download a few example files (at least for the
notebook about Sequence Input and Output)


Jupyter conversion effort
-------------------------
