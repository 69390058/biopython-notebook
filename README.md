biopython-notebook
==================

Notebooks to introduce biopython. The vast majority of the content is
not mine, I am just responsible for making a ipython notebook version
of otherwise existing content.

Most content here is based on the Biopython tutorial or on Peter Cock's
workshop.


Docker instructions

For docker we need to download a few example files (at least for the
notebook about Sequence Input and Output)

./tiago
