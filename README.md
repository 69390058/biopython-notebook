biopython-notebook
==================

Notebooks to introduce biopython. The vast majority of the content is
scooped from somewhere else. This project is focused on making this existing content avalible and interactive with Jupyter notebooks.

Most content here is based on the [Biopython tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).
